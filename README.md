## Project Brief:  
The brief for this project was to design and produce a web app of my choosing. The app needed to have CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality, needed to use the Flask micro-framework, and had to store information in a MySQL database comprised of a minimum of two tables sharing a one-to-many relationship.  

## App Design:
I have chosen to build a blog application web, which allows students to write posts and concerns (create functionality), view their posts (read functionality), update posts (update functionality) and delete posts (delete functionality). The database for this project comprises a Student table and posts table, with each student associated with multiple posts (one-to-many relationship). 

## Couldnt progress any further due to programs crashing
